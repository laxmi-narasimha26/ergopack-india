# How to use this checklist

* For each item mark: **Pass / Fail / N/A**.
* Required evidence for each Fail: *short description*, *steps to reproduce*, *expected vs actual*, *logs/screenshots/video*, *commit/PR that fixes it*.
* Priorities: **Critical** (blocker), **High**, **Medium**, **Low**. Critical & High must be fixed before launch.
* Where possible require automated test coverage (unit, integration, E2E) and that test results be attached.
